# Library-system
Our Project is a graduation project from Instant Software Solution diploma for Software Engineering Track. 

# Project Description

In this project we used C++ programming language, OOP for C++, data structure and SOLID principles to make cashier library system.

Our client wants to make a system for his library that sell and lend books to people. 

#### There are three categories:
1.	Books (Engineering Books, Medical Books, Religious Books)

2.  Magazines

3.	Short Stories

We have 9 books for each type of book but we should keep 3 in stock for our books and an unlimited number for Magazines and Short Stories.

We have two types of employees:
1.	A fixed worker (Lifelong contract) (Ten workers).
    (They have privileges to sell or lend any category)
    
2.	A six daily reward worker (Daily payment) (Six workers). 
    (They have privileges to lend only any category)
    
Our books are stored lengthwise and when we lend any book I should make sure that the stock isn’t equal to zero.

Our system should ask the employee if he/she fixed or daily

If fixed let him/her enter a name and check if this employee is allowed or not. This Employee is allowed to sell or lend any book.

For the Daily employee, we should also check the name and the privilege for this employee is to lend only books.
